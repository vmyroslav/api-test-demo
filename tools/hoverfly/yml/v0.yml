  # problem:
  # - how we can extract {id} value
  # - do we need to extract it?
  # - do we need specify if it is a uuid or a number or some other id
  /api/v1/Activities/{id}:
    # for now - omitted, as I don't know if we should specify content type
    # content:
    # application/json

    # method of the endpoint, shouldn't be changed, as different methods has different response bodies
    GET:
      # Could change over time!
      # for now fields - as a templating on what fields we want to change or template
      # possible changes:
      # - add requestBody and responseBody and probably headers or smth else -
      # as it allows us to modify them (f.e. Operation-ID or Operation-Link).
      #
      fields:
        dueDate: $time
